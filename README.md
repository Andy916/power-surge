# PowerSurge ⚡

A small Godot game I made back in high school. Recovered from a `.pck` file using GDRETools and rebuilt for archival and reflection.

## 🎮 About
PowerSurge is a short 2D platformer with self-made sprites and basic gameplay mechanics. It’s not polished, but it’s part of my early journey into game development.

## 🛠️ Recovery Process
- Decompiled using GDRETools
- Reorganized into scenes, scripts, and assets
- Rebuilt in Godot 4.5
- Exported to Windows

## 📦 Build
- `builds/PowerSurge.exe`: Playable Windows version

## 📁 Structure
- `godot-project/`: Full Godot project folder
- `builds/`: Exported executable for Windows

## 🧠 Notes
This game isn’t great — but it’s real. I’m keeping it here as part of my development history.
